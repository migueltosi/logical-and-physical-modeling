A ERD Database Modeling revision nootebok. <br/>
Practicing concepts, models and ilustrations. <br/>

<hr>
<p>The project is a Jupyter Notebook file containing topics, images, texts and comments.<p/>
<p>I worked on the database of a supposed company called ZigMarket (devised by me).<p/>
<p>ZigMarket sells products (ZigItems) and rights to these products (ZigOwns)<p>
<hr>
<p>Zigmarket, at least at this moment, was idealized only for the proposed practice.<p>
